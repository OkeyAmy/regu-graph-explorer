# Contributing to Regu-Graph Explorer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Regu-Graph Explorer! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug Reports**: Report bugs and issues you encounter
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features and improvements
- **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests with code changes
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Testing**: Help test the application and report issues
- **Design**: Contribute to UI/UX improvements

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your contribution is already being worked on
2. **Read the README** to understand the project structure
3. **Review the TODO list** to see current development priorities
4. **Join discussions** in GitHub Discussions to get feedback on your ideas

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (recommended) or npm
- **Git**: Latest version
- **Code Editor**: VS Code with recommended extensions (see below)

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd regu-graph-explorer

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: Tailwind CSS support
- **TypeScript Importer**: Auto-import TypeScript modules
- **GitLens**: Enhanced Git functionality

## üìã Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a simple branching strategy:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Development branch for features
- **feature/***: Feature branches (e.g., `feature/document-viewer`)
- **bugfix/***: Bug fix branches (e.g., `bugfix/pdf-rendering`)
- **hotfix/***: Critical production fixes

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Ensure you're on the develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add document viewer component"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add PDF document viewer component
fix(workspace): resolve canvas rendering issues
docs: update README with new features
refactor(store): simplify state management
```

## üèóÔ∏è Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Strict Mode**: Always use strict TypeScript settings
- **Type Definitions**: Define interfaces for all props, state, and API responses
- **Avoid `any`**: Use proper types or `unknown` when necessary
- **Generic Types**: Use generics for reusable, type-safe logic

### React Guidelines

- **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- **Props Interface**: Define interfaces for all component props
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for global state, local state for component-specific data
- **Performance**: Implement React.memo and useMemo when appropriate

### Styling Guidelines

- **Tailwind CSS**: Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- **Component Variants**: Use class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # React components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/        # Feature-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/         # Layout components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store/              # Zustand stores
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # API and business logic services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                # Utility functions and configurations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for utility functions and hooks
- **Component Tests**: Test component behavior with React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and workflows
- **Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run specific test file
pnpm test -- src/components/workspace/DocumentViewer.test.tsx
```

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Example test structure
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { DocumentViewer } from './DocumentViewer';

describe('DocumentViewer', () => {
  it('renders PDF content correctly', () => {
    const mockDocumentData = { /* mock data */ };
    
    render(<DocumentViewer documentData={mockDocumentData} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Document Title')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('handles missing document data gracefully', () => {
    render(<DocumentViewer documentData={null} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('No document loaded')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
