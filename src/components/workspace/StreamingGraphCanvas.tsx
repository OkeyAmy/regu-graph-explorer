 * Streaming Graph Canvas - Real-time visualization component

/*
// Original StreamingGraphCanvas implementation - commented out but preserved
// This component handled real-time streaming updates from the AI processing pipeline
// and rendered them as an interactive graph with nodes and connections.
// 
// Key features that were implemented:
// - Real-time streaming updates as chunks are processed  
// - Progressive rendering of document hierarchy
// - Smooth animations for new nodes and connections
// - Integration with LangChain streaming responses
// - Reference highlighting between document sections
// - Interactive node selection and navigation
// 
// The complete implementation has been preserved in git history
// and can be restored if needed in the future.

// Placeholder component - StreamingGraphCanvas functionality moved to DocumentViewer
