 * Adaptive canvas that renders streaming data progressively

/*
// Original AdaptiveCanvas implementation - commented out but preserved
// This was the main canvas component that rendered the graph visualization
// using ReactFlow to display hierarchical document structure as nodes and edges.
// 
// Key features that were implemented:
// - Real-time streaming updates as AI processes document chunks
// - Interactive node selection and highlighting
// - Reference connections between document sections
// - Adaptive layout with multiple layout modes
// - Search and filter capabilities
// - Responsive design with zoom and pan controls
// 
// The complete implementation has been preserved in git history
// and can be restored if needed in the future.
